# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

As students embark on their coding bootcamp adventure, the amount of information being consumed can be overwhelming. This project was designed to be a learning tool that would help students keep track of everything they are learning in the Prework. This includes information on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Usage

This study guide includes sections on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Each section contains highlights of important information related to each topic that can serve as a refresher throughout the course of the bootcamp. In addition to the list of information in the JavaScript section, you can open Chrome DevTools and open the console to see the JavaScript code running. You will see a list of the topics covered along with a randomized topic that is recommended for study each time you open the console. This webpage can continue to be updated with new programming languages throughout the duration of the bootcamp.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
